Prime numbers are fascinating and have been a subject of curiosity from decades. The reason for their hype roots to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.

> Formally, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

In this post, we will go through a simple yet effective algorithm which is known as **Sieve of Eratosthenes** to find all the prime numbers below a given limit.

The reason we are interested in this particular algorithm is because of its efficiency in terms of time complexity which is `O(nloglogn)`. In fact, It is the most effective algorithm for finding prime numbers up to 10 million.

## Algorithm

- Create a list of integers from _2_ to _n_.
- Start with _p_ being equal to _2_, the smallest prime number.
- Mark the multiples of _p_ starting from _p \* p_ up to _n_ one by one, the _p_ itself should not be marked.
- Find the first number greater than _p_ in the list that is not marked. If there is no such number, stop. Otherwise, set _p_ equal to this new number, and repeat from step 3.
- When the algorithm terminates, the numbers which are not marked in the list are all the primes below _n_.

## Implementation

```python
def sieves(n):
    primes = [1] * n
    primes[0] = primes[1] = 0
    total = 0

    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if p:
            i = p * p
            while i < n:
                primes[i] = 0
                i += p
        p += 1

    primes = [i for i, j in enumerate(primes) if j]

    return primes
```

This is a straight forward implementation of the algorithm.
Here, we initialize all the indices up to _n_ with _1(True)_ except 0 and 1 as they are not prime numbers.
Next, we iterate for every number which has not been marked(has _1(True)_) and set(mark) its multiples to _0(False)_ starting. Notice we start marking the multiples after the square of _p_ to avoid marking the numbers which already have been marked.
When the outer loop terminates, we obtain our prime numbers.

### Optimization

As we know that the only even prime number we have is 2 so we don't need to deal with even numbers as all they are doing is taking space in our array.
So the idea is to only apply sieves to odd numbers to find primes and add 2 in the end. Turns out with a little bit of simple index arithmetic we can easily optimize our previous implementation.
Since we will be only dealing with odd numbers, we will treat index i as number _(2 \* i) + 1_.
For instance, index _1_ will be treated as number _3_.
Consequently, the square of the number at index i will be at index _(2 * i) * (i + 1)_ and the step to be taken in the inner loop will be _(2 \* i) + 1_.

```python
def sieves(n):
    if n < 2:
        return []

    n = n // 2
    primes = [1] * n
    primes[0] = 0

    i = 1
    while (2 * i) * (i + 1) <= n:
        if i:
            j = (2 * i) * (i + 1)
            while j < n:
                primes[j] = 0
                j += (2 * i) + 1
        i += 1

    primes = [(2 * i) + 1 for i, j in enumerate(primes) if j]
    primes.insert(0, 2)

    return primes
```
