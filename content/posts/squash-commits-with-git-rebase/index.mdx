Have you ever run into a situation where you end up doing a lot of commits which are similar and could have been put in a single commit?

Well, _git_ has got you covered.

Git provides interactive rebase command which can be used to squash several commits into a single commit.

#### Demonstration

- For demonstration, I have already created a git repository with _notes.txt_.

```bash
Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ ls -a
./  ../  .git/  notes.txt
```

```bash
Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ cat notes.txt
A list of useful git commands:
```

```bash
Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ git log --oneline
c5ec2de (HEAD -> master) Initial commit
```

- Now, I am going to add three different commits which will add a single point each in _notes.txt_.

```bash
Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ git log --oneline
998c20c (HEAD -> master) Add point no. 3
5123573 Add point no. 2
e94c4a9 Add point no. 1
c5ec2de Initial commit
```

```bash
Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ cat notes.txt
A list of useful git commands:
1) git add
2) git commit
3) git status
```

- Since these three commits are pretty much similar and could be done in a single commit, I am going to use `git rebase -i HEAD~no_of_commits_to_squash` to squash these commits into one.

```bash
Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

- Next, there will be a prompt to choose the operation that we'd like want to perform.

```bash
pick e94c4a9 Add point no. 1
pick 5123573 Add point no. 2
pick 998c20c Add point no. 3

# Rebase c5ec2de..998c20c onto c5ec2de (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

For squashing, I am going to choose,

```bash
s - for squash
and
r - for rename
```

_Remember to choose the oldest commit to rename and the rest of the commits to squash._

```bash
r e94c4a9 Add point no. 1
s 5123573 Add point no. 2
s 998c20c Add point no. 3
```

- Git now will prompt to rename the chosen commit.

```bash
Add point no. 1

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Sat Aug 10 17:08:17 2019 +0530
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto c5ec2de
# Last command done (1 command done):
#    reword e94c4a9 Add point no. 1
# Next commands to do (2 remaining commands):
#    squash 5123573 Add point no. 2
#    squash 998c20c Add point no. 3
# You are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch 'master' on 'c5ec2de'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   notes.txt
#
```

- I am going to rename the file, save and close the editor to proceed.

```bash
Add points

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Sat Aug 10 17:08:17 2019 +0530
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto c5ec2de
# Last command done (1 command done):
#    reword e94c4a9 Add point no. 1
# Next commands to do (2 remaining commands):
#    squash 5123573 Add point no. 2
#    squash 998c20c Add point no. 3
# You are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch 'master' on 'c5ec2de'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   notes.txt
#
```

- Next, Git will prompt us to write a commit message for our final commit.

```bash
# This is a combination of 3 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

Add points

# This is the commit message #2:

Add point no. 2

# This is the commit message #3:

Add point no. 3

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Sat Aug 10 17:08:17 2019 +0530
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto c5ec2de
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    squash 5123573 Add point no. 2
#    squash 998c20c Add point no. 3
# No commands remaining.
# You are currently rebasing branch 'master' on 'c5ec2de'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   notes.txt
#
```

- I am going to edit the commit message, save and close the editor again to proceed.

```bash
Add points

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Sat Aug 10 17:08:17 2019 +0530
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto c5ec2de
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    squash 5123573 Add point no. 2
#    squash 998c20c Add point no. 3
# No commands remaining.
# You are currently rebasing branch 'master' on 'c5ec2de'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   notes.txt
#
```

- If everything goes right, you will see a success message in your terminal.

```bash
Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file...

```

- **Voila!** We are done.

```bash
Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ git log --oneline
ef9a545 (HEAD -> master) Add points
c5ec2de Initial commit
```

```bash
Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ cat notes.txt
A list of useful git commands:
1) git add
2) git commit
3) git status
```

We have successfully squashed those three commits into one.

#### A word of advice

Git rebase rewrites history which can create problems when working with a team. Make sure that you are aware of what you are trying to do before squashing.
If you are new to this concept, I would suggest you to create a _backup_ branch before you proceed.
